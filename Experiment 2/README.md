The goal of this experiment was to see whether implementing the elastic weight consolidation (EWC) algorithm would prevent catastrophic interference in word2vec. We also checked to see whether the alternate random vector accumulation (RVA) architecture was similarly affected by catastrophic interference. We found that EWC was not effective at preventing memory loss due to catastrophic interference while the RVA model was entirely unaffected.
