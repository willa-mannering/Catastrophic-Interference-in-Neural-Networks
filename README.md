Experiment 1 shows catastrophic interference effects in a neural network in both artificial and natural language corpora.
Experiment 2 shows catastrophic interference effects in a neural network, a neural network with elastic weight consolidation (EWC), and a random vector accumulation (RVA) model.

We found that EWC was unable to prevent catastrophic interference in neural networks and that the RVA model was unaffected by catastrophic interference.
